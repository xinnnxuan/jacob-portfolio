    <h1>The Story Behind the Grind</h1>
    <p>Marketing, Mountains, and the Pursuit of Excellence</p>

    <h2>Why I Love What I Do</h2>
    <p>My journey into marketing wasn't planned—it was discovered through a love for connecting people with experiences that matter. Growing up in Spokane, I learned early that the best stories aren't just told; they're lived. Whether I'm crafting a campaign for Spokane Racquet Club or training for my next Ironman, I'm driven by the same principle: authentic connection creates lasting impact.</p>
    
    <p>Marketing, to me, is about understanding the human experience. When I work with brands like Wilson and Luxilon, I'm not just selling products—I'm helping athletes find the tools that will push them beyond their limits. It's the same mindset I bring to my own training: every detail matters, every decision counts.</p>

    <h2>What Drives Me as an Endurance Athlete</h2>
    <p>Endurance sports taught me that limits are just suggestions. Every 5 AM swim session, every 100-mile bike ride, every marathon finish line—they all taught me that the impossible becomes possible when you break it down into manageable steps. This philosophy drives everything I do, from building marketing campaigns to coaching tennis players.</p>

    <p>Built the analytical and creative foundation that would later define my approach to marketing and problem-solving.</p>
    
    <h3>2014-2020 - Retail Experience</h3>
    <p>Learned the art of customer connection, visual merchandising, and the psychology behind purchasing decisions. This hands-on experience became the backbone of my marketing philosophy.</p>

    <p>Currently pursuing advanced studies while applying real-world experience to create impactful marketing strategies for sports and outdoor brands.</p>

    <h2>Currently Training for Ironman California 2025</h2>
    <p>Every morning starts with a choice: comfort or growth. I choose growth. Whether it's a 6-mile run before sunrise or a 3-hour bike session through the mountains, I'm building not just physical strength, but mental resilience that translates to every aspect of my work.</p>
